the goal of this project is to emulate shell.
in this program there are builtin functions created by us and functions executed through execve.

#builtins function
- cd
- pwd
- exit
- unset
- env
- export

there are some bugs to fix as having made a basic version without bonus 
some features of a normal shell are not enabled.

# How to launch our minishell
just need to launch sh start.sh and automatically it will be ready on your terminal.
